### Hey there!
I'm JxstErg1, a 17-year-old developer, an IT expert somewhat, a gamer, a server stack maintainer, and who more has more puts (translated from the Italian proverb "e chi più ne ha più ne metta"). I can speak English...
<!-- e so anche parlare italiano! -->
...and that comment above says that I can also speak Italian, and it's also a mother tongue because I'm Italian.
I'm also making a new website now, so this repo will be updated when I have to.
